### Why Correlated Noise?

Hey, welcome.

For a few years now, I've wanted to spin up a website to share technical information, write-ups, tips and techniques, and have a place to document different projects-- but it was always on the backburner. A WordPress site here, a local built demo page there, but nothing really clicked for me and I kept changing my mind on how I wanted to word and present the knowledge I wanted to share.

After a few attempts that never felt write and ever changing priorities, I decided to force a commitment to launch this site and keep the web-aspect of it as simple as possible so that I only need to think about writing content. It turns out my love for writing notes in Markdown paid off after digging through the GitHub Pages documentation

Reflecting on my personal documentation as well as the training programs and Knowledge Base articles I've professionally written I decided to take a hybrid approach. The primary content will be all encompassing, in-depth technical documentation like the Cisco, Offensive Security, and ISC2 notes/study guides I made for myself.

Since that style of writing takes a great deal of time, I'm going to offset it with shorter posts on singular topics whenever I start feeling the tinge of burnout for the subject of a larger post and have reached a stopping point that will let me set it aside without losing my place or train of thought.

This brings me to why I chose the name Correlated Noise. As you can tell, I have a whirlwind of ideas to fill this site with. In that chaos there's an overwhelming amount of knowledge that I *completely* forgot that I've gained over my professional career.

The metaphoric signal-to-noise ratio inside my head is out of whack. The different protocols, technologies, and methodologies I've studied are overlapping and stepping on each other, blurring the fine details into a pseudo-white noise. This blog is really my attempt to combat that. To dive into the sea of noise, lock onto a certain signal, correlate what is truly similar, filter out the anomalies, and most importantly, share it with others.

### My Background

Alright, enough reaching for metaphors on why I'm posting things online. It feels awkward to talk about myself, but this should give some form of credibility to the content of my posts.

First off, I'm incredibly grateful for my Dad having access to the early computer networks that preceded the Internet when he was in University. His exposure, and downright awe, at the level of information sharing that is possible with networked computers lead him to always have a modern computer at home throughout the years. My parents are still storing Christmas ornaments in an old Macintosh IIci box that's a few feet from the work computer my Dad had built decades ago that I believe still has a fully functioning Pentium II that I used to play C&C Red Alert on whenever I was at his office.

Without his passion for computers and electronics rubbing off on my older brother, and then on me, I don't think I would have taken the same path in life. That primed interest in all things electronics. Combining that with my brother and our cousin with having access to the cornerstones of cyberpunk and hacking media like The Matrix, Ghost in the Shell, System Shock, and every other issue of *2600: The Hacker Quarterly* before I even got to High School... Yeah, it's no surprise I went the path I chose.

Personal life aside, I ended up following in my brother's footsteps by going through the same program for Computer Networking Systems in college. The program was based around Cisco's Networking Academy which condensed what normally would be a four-year degree program into two years, covering the CCNA Route and Switch, CCNP Route and Switch, as well as the CCNA Security and the Troubleshooting portion of the CCNP over the two summer semesters.

Pretty early on I opted to dual-major into Computer System Support Technology to round out my education with more electrical engineering and hardware courses. I passed the CCNA Route and Switch and the CCNA Security certifications before graduating. This helped start my career by landing a position at a local ILEC/ISP/MSP when my final summer semester started, albeit at a help desk level.

My thirst for knowledge, and my college program's agreement that if you certify you automatically pass that semester, I wound up binging the CCNP Route and Switch and passing all three tests while working at the help desk and used that to claim an A on my last course to finish out my two Associate's degrees. This gave me the extra leverage to earn a promotion and move from help desk to engineering and let me consume every drop of knowledge I could manage on Analog and SIP  telephony, carrier level and enterprise level networking, Wi-Fi, and dip my toes into real InfoSec by taking over the majority of firewall and network security work.

Of course not everything goes smoothly. There was a period in time that I was temporarily laid off for roughly half a year due to budget cuts. Thankfully the relationships I made during college, and some incredibly lucky timing, gave me the opportunity to instruct a semester of CCENT-level networking at my alma mater during that time. Words cannot describe how rewarding that experience was on both a professional and personal level. I'm no orator, let alone a good public speaker, yet that classroom engagement and seeing my students pass and get certified felt sublime.

After regaining my engineering position, I used what I learned while teaching to write departmental documentation in-between my normal duties. This evolved into giving refresher and new-hire training sessions on the topics in which I became the designated Subject Matter Expert for, then helping a colleague revise our existing training program, and eventually rebuilding my department's entire new-hire training program to cover every aspect of what we do in our department to eliminate the worst parts of the "trial by fire" and "learn as you go" approach to training that I experienced.

I never stopped my own personal studies even with the move to a more senior engineer with quasi-management responsibilities. When the pandemic started and the move to working from home happened, all the extra free time I gained in 2020 was spent diving into passing Offensive Security's OSCP and ISC2's CISSP. Granted, my journey through the OSCP is a lot more complicated than I'm letting on here and I'm going to cover that in it's own post.

I took the knowledge and skills I acquired from both certifications to establish a better security posture for my department. Whenever I would volunteer myself to the core network or service platform engineering groups to pilot test any new products or changes to existing products I did my best to bring in a security-focused perspective.

### In Summary

I'm primarily a voice and data network engineer with almost a decade of professional experience in the Service Provider and Telecommunications industries. My lifelong interests in hacker culture and hobbyist/DIY electronics steer me further towards a career in cybersecurity.

I've obtained the Cisco Certified Networking Professional - Routing and Switching, Cisco Certified Network Associate - Security, Offensive Security Certified Professional, and most recently the Certified Information Systems Security Professional certifications.

When I'm not working towards my next professional goal or blowing off steam with unrelated hobbies, I'm usually on Hack The Box, tinkering with RF or 3D Printing, and falling into different rabbit holes by over-researching seemingly random topics.

One of my core beliefs is the value of sharing knowledge and helping others obtain a full understanding of that knowledge. That isn't just about technical knowledge-- the humanities and gaining a better understanding of oneself are, in my opinion, more important. I'm not in a position to speak on those subjects but I can at least offer what technical knowledge I've picked up over the years, which brings this back to the purpose of this site.
